The **new** way to allow ***everyone*** to listen and party to **music** they ***actually vibe to***! 🎶

# 🎉 KEW - Song requests made easy. 🎉

Kew is a software that makes it super easy for DJs to receive song requests at parties and for partygoers to send them! Simply scan the QR code search for a song to add the request to the queue. The DJ will receive all the song requests in real-time, sorted by popular request.

🎧 Pumped for semi-formal or prom but the DJ just ***doesn't deliver***?  
Music is crucial for setting the mood. Nobody wants to be stuck with boring tunes when there are so many bangers out there. 

Can't blame the DJ though, how are they supposed to know your taste? 

That’s where **Kew** steps in! No more waiting in line to request a song — do it via **Kew**. 

Want your song played sooner? Pay the DJ a tip to get your song *boosted* to the top, OR you can get a shoutout too! Enjoy your night your way, and see what others are vibing to by checking out the next songs in the Kew. 🎵

Instead of wasting time waiting in line at the DJ booth, simply **queue** your song requests on **Kew**. Your song request instantly gets sent straight to the DJ’s screen. 
The platform automatically prioritizes the most highly requested songs to keep the majority grooving. 

Don't like the songs playing and want to hear your song sooner?  
**GREAT NEWS**: with **Kew Tips**, you can send the DJ a tip to bump your song to the top. And if you're with that special someone when the mood for a slow dance hits, pay a small fee for an unforgettable experience. 🌌
